# SCENARIO 3: Down the Silvia River (891 SI, February)
# After you realize that, since you killed a Marauder prince, they will keep attacking you until you die, you decide to leave the province, bringing with you all people of Lavinian descent, a small group. (Those native to the region will not be enslaved by the marauders; besides, you don't really care about them anyway.) There is one other major city in the region, Portum Frigae. You have to go down the river, to this port city.
# As you travel, a Marauder warband appears on the other side of the river, which you have been traveling next to. You have to shepherd your charges down the road, and then stall the Marauders before making your retreat. You should have a few slow-moving Nobleman units, which need to be brought to a signpost. Once this is done, you have to survive for, say, 5 turns. Then you win. You can also win by killing the Marauder leader, but that should be rather hard.
